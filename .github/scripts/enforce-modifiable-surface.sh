# core.quotePath=false so the diff emits RAW UTF-8 pathnames, not git's default

# is inert against exactly the non-ASCII spellings it exists to catch -- e.g.
# `.gitmoduleſ` (U+017F LONG S), which APFS case-folds to `.gitmodules` (same
# inode) but ASCII `tr` does not. Injected at THIS call site, not in
# hardened-git.sh (kept byte-faithful to the original): only this gate parses
# git-emitted pathnames; the overlay and the manifest linter read editablePaths
# from JSON via jq and are unaffected by git's quoting.

# ADDITION (pinned measurement harness), the same rule overlay-editable-paths.sh
# applies and the manifest linter asserts: a diff reaching what decides which
# scorer runs is refused HERE too -- independently of what the base contract's
# editablePaths happen to say. Without this the gate is the one layer of the
# three that would admit the write if the trusted contract ever drifted.
#
# WHAT THE PROTECTED THING IS NOW. benchd used to be a SHA-pinned source
# submodule at `benchd`, pointed at by `.gitmodules`. It is now a pinned
# PREBUILT binary resolved from the dist channel (the `benchd.pin` sha pin is
# RETIRED -- David ruling 2026-08-27 -- but the spelling stays FORBIDDEN below so
# a submission can never plant a pin file and confuse tooling): historically it named {branch, commit, sha256, bytes} and
# tools/fetch-benchd.sh resolves it into `benchd-bin/`. So the pin file and the
# resolved-binary directory are the live entries -- writing the pin repoints the
# scorer, writing benchd-bin swaps the bytes after verification. The two
# submodule spellings are KEPT rather than dropped: they cost nothing and a
# reintroduced gitlink must be covered on arrival, not after someone remembers.
#
# Two-armed, mirroring overlay-editable-paths.sh:31-66 and lint-benchmark-manifest.py
# so the three layers that read this editable surface cannot diverge about which
# spellings reach the pinned scorer. Before this port the surface gate carried
# only arm (1) where the overlay and the linter already carried both.
#
#   (1) CASE FOLD. The ranked box is macOS and APFS is case-INSENSITIVE by
#       default, so `BENCHD.PIN` and `benchd.pin` are the same file there and a
#       byte-comparison guard would stop only one spelling of the same write.
#   (2) FILESYSTEM IDENTITY (device:inode). A changed path whose own prefix
#       RESOLVES to the protected inode is refused even when ASCII case folding
#       does not normalise its spelling (Unicode case folding, HFS+/APFS
#       normalisation). This is the arm the overlay and the linter carry and the
#       surface gate did not, so under trusted-contract drift a spelling the
#       filesystem resolves to the submodule could pass HERE while the other two
#       refused it.
# `Vendor/mlx-swift-lm` is the LIVE gitlink: the engine fork is a submodule, so a
# diff reaching it repoints the pinned fork the run builds. The manifest linter
# has always refused the spelling; the two shell layers did not, and lockstep is
# the property this list exists for.
