# ADDITION (pinned measurement harness). benchd is what MEASURES a submission.
# It used to be a SHA-pinned source submodule at `benchd`, pointed at by
# `.gitmodules`; it is now a channel-resolved PREBUILT binary -- the retired `benchd.pin` spelling named
# {branch, commit, sha256, bytes} and tools/fetch-benchd.sh resolves it into
# `benchd-bin/`. An editable entry reaching the pin or the resolved binary would
# let a submission repoint or replace its own scorer, so the overlay refuses to
# act on such an entry by construction rather than trusting the manifest linter
# to have caught it. The two submodule spellings are KEPT so a reintroduced
# gitlink is covered on arrival. The original had nothing here to protect.
#
# `Vendor/mlx-swift-lm` is the LIVE gitlink: the engine fork is a submodule, and
# a gitlink is not an editable path -- overlaying one would replace the pinned
# fork with whatever the archive carries. The manifest linter has always refused
# the spelling; the two shell layers did not, which is the disagreement this
# entry closes.
#
# Kept in lockstep with enforce-modifiable-surface.sh FORBIDDEN_SURFACE_PATHS
# and lint-benchmark-manifest.py FORBIDDEN_EDITABLE: the three layers that read
# this editable surface must not disagree about which spellings reach the scorer
# or the pinned fork.

### Stale-editable-file detection (report-only) ###############################
#
# The overlay takes the SUBMISSION's copy of every editablePath wholesale. That
# is correct for files the participant actually edited, but it also carries
# over their copy of editable files they never touched -- so an operator change
# to an editable file made AFTER the candidate branched is silently replaced by
# the pre-change content. Two consequences: this ranked run builds and measures
# the older file, not trusted main's; and on promotion the older content lands
# back on main, reverting the operator edit.
#
# Report-only on purpose. Failing here would reject a legitimate submission for
# something the participant did not do, and dropping the file from the overlay
# would change what the ranked run measures -- both are policy calls, not this
# script's. Skipped silently when TRUSTED_MAIN_SHA is unset or the merge base
# cannot be resolved.
