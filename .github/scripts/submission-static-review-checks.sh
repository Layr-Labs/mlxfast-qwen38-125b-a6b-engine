### Which contract states the rules ###########################################
#
# DIFF MODE (MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_BASE_SHA set) reviews an UNTRUSTED
# checkout. Upstream runs this step in the submission checkout BEFORE the
# overlay (qwen-mtp-ranked-benchmark.yml@bfab0de:1198-1204), so every byte of
# that work tree -- benchmark.json included -- is attacker-controlled.
# Therefore EVERY rule this script enforces is resolved from the review BASE
# blob and never from the work tree: the byte caps, the track id, the editable
# allowlist and the exemptions alike. Reading any of them from the work tree is
# a self-widening primitive -- a submission that raises its own maxGrowthBytes
# passes a growth its base contract refuses, and one that rewrites
# staticReviewTrackId selects which policy judges it.
#
# WHOLE-SURFACE MODE reads the contract from the WORK TREE, which is only safe
# because it runs in the TRUSTED checkout after the overlay. Nothing in this
# script can verify that precondition, so the mode is an EXPLICIT OPT-IN:
# MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_MODE=whole-surface. It used to be the fallback
# whenever MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_BASE_SHA happened to be unset, which put
# the whole self-widening primitive one missing environment variable away --
# an attacker checkout with self-widened caps and no base sha reviewed itself
# against its own contract and exited 0. A caller that forgets to compute the
# base now gets a refusal, not the permissive mode.
#
# MODE SELECTION, in full:
#   BASE_SHA set-but-empty                    -> fatal (base computation failed)

### The byte caps #############################################################
#
# The caps come from the contract SOURCE resolved above, not from constants in
# this file. The original pinned them as script defaults and asked a comment to
# keep them in sync with the Swift enforcer (bfab0de:32-38); here the manifest
# is the single source and the fallbacks below only cover a contract that
# declares none.
#
# A cap key that is PRESENT must be a positive integer JSON NUMBER. Anything
# else -- "2000000", false, null, 3.5 -- is malformed and fails closed, key for
# key with Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift
# (divergence D2). jq's `// empty` could not express that: it reads false and
# null as ABSENT (so the cap silently fell back to the constant) and -r
# stringifies "2000000" into a value that then passed the integer regex below,
# so a submission-supplied string silently WIDENED the cap it was checked
# against.
#
# RULED (David 2026-08-20), engine issue #20, review finding B6 / R1.15: ALIGN
# SHELL TO SWIFT. Resolution is `manifest > constant` here, as it already was in
# Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift, so D1's "the
# manifest is the single source" now holds for BOTH enforcers instead of only
# one. The three environment overrides this script used to consult ahead of the
# manifest -- MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_STATIC_REVIEW_MAX_BYTES / _MAX_FILE_BYTES /
# _MAX_GROWTH_BYTES, ported from main.swift@bfab0de:2365-2372 -- are GONE, not
# deprecated. The lever they gave a trusted operator (re-state one run's caps
# without editing the contract) is deliberately given up: a cap that can be
# re-stated out of band is not a single source, and the reviewed run could
# differ from the contract with nothing in the record saying so.
#
# Neither direction was ever a submission-reachable bypass -- these were
# trusted-operator inputs and a submission has no way to set them -- so this
# closes a doctrine divergence, not a hole. Do not reintroduce an environment
# path here without reopening #20: the two enforcers must not drift apart again.

# not, and either way the two enforcers stop agreeing about what the budget is.
#
# maxTotalBytes was 3000000 here for a while after the declaration and the
# Swift enforcer's defaultMaxTotalBytes had already been re-derived. The
# 4204273 value was derived on 2026-08-28, by the 1 MiB-margin method, over
# the editable surface as the Qwen 3.8 125B A6B port left it (the four
# Qwen4Exp model files replacing the Gemma tower). Nothing in the linter
# noticed the earlier drift: tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py checked the SWIFT enforcer's
# fallbacks against the manifest and this script's not at all. It checks both
# now -- do not edit a number below without editing benchmark.json, or that
# check (and drift/shell fallback constants equal the manifest in
# tools/test-submission-security.sh) reds.
#
# maxTotalBytes was RE-DERIVED on the Darkbloom CBv2 re-base, from 9447153 to
# 2706783. The surface lost Sources/MLXFastModel and the eighteen
# Vendor/mlx-swift-lm entries (the fork is a submodule, so its files are not
# editable): 1658207 bytes at rest over 110 files, plus the stated 1 MiB
# margin.
#
# RAISED AGAIN 2026-09-08, from 2706783 to 3771619, when `Runner/` joined the
# editable surface. The Runner is the model family's code, and it lived inside
# the pinned fork submodule where a participant could not edit it; the copy
# adds 16260 bytes, and the cap moves by that plus the same 1 MiB margin. The
# old cap was already 72284 bytes under the stated minimum margin before the
# Runner arrived.

    # only through a link counted zero bytes and the surface passed. Diff mode
    # already rejects a non-regular changed path (the `-h || ! -f` test above);
    # whole-surface mode carried no such check. Reject any symlink -- or any other
    # non-regular, non-directory entry -- under the reviewed surface, matching
    # both the diff-mode check and the overlay's validate_overlay_tree.
