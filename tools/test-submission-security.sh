# Hostile-archive E2E suite for the submission-restriction enforcers (issue #16).
#
# Every case synthesizes a malicious (or benign) submission and asserts that it
# dies at the RIGHT layer with the RIGHT diagnostic, or survives when it should.
# Nothing here needs weights, a GPU, a network, or a box.
#
# HARD GATE: this suite must be green before any real submission is dispatched.
# The `swift` job of .github/workflows/ci.yml runs it on every pull request and
# every push to main, so a regression turns the run red. That is CI coverage and
# not a mechanical interlock: NO STATUS CHECK IS REQUIRED ANYWHERE IN THIS
# REPOSITORY -- branch protection is unavailable on this plan (403), there is no
# CODEOWNERS, and a red run blocks neither a merge nor a dispatch. CI here is
# ADVISORY by ruling (David 2026-08-20; the two-session red-team is the de facto
# merge gate), and dispatch-time gating is deferred with the ranked runner
# (docs/submission-restriction-spec.md section 9), so today a red gate stops a
# dispatch only because a human reads it. Keep it hosted-runner-clean -- an
# assertion that needs a box, a credential or the network cannot go in this
# file.

# Under Actions the caller's environment carries the job's real step-to-step

# four QMTP_* fixture paths into every later CI step this way. All four
# writable channels are dropped -- the other three had no writer in-tree at

# A section that stops running -- deleted, renamed out of the flow, or skipped by
# an early `continue` -- leaves every REMAINING assertion green, so exit status
# alone cannot notice it and the gate silently shrinks. This floor is the single
# place the suite's expected size is recorded; raise it in the same commit that
# adds assertions. Checked in the trailer below, and deliberately a floor rather
# than an equality so adding a case does not fail the run that adds it.
#
# IT CANNOT BE THE ONLY FLOOR. This file runs `set -uo pipefail` without `-e`,
# and the check below is in this same file's trailer: truncate the file, or add
# an early `exit 0`, and the floor goes with the assertions it was guarding --
# the CI step then goes green on a gate that ran nothing. The workflow restates
# it from OUTSIDE, against this script's printed trailer, exactly as
# tools/ci-swift-warning-gate.sh guards the build from outside the build:
# .github/workflows/ci.yml, step "Submission-security suite did not shrink",
# whose CI_MIN_ASSERTIONS is cross-checked against the number below so the two
# cannot drift apart in silence. Raise BOTH in the same commit.
#
# 287 -> 259 on 2026-08-27 with the DFlash arm removal: the arm-selection
# and staged-head sections went with the arm they guarded, and the floor had
# to follow the assertions that still exist. This is the ONLY sanctioned way
# the number goes down: it drops in the same change that deletes the
# assertions, never to make a red suite go green.
#
# 259 -> 236 on the Darkbloom CBv2 re-base, on the same rule. Section I (the
# target-quantization bind) asserted the bind lives in the non-editable
# Sources/MLXFastHarness worker target; that target is deleted and the bind is
# the fork's now. Section H's editable-model-file loop asserted four
# Vendor/mlx-swift-lm files are editablePaths entries; they are inside a
# submodule, and a gitlink is not an editable path. Both subjects left the
# tree, so both sets of assertions left with them.

# spelling of a CURRENT forbidden path IS constructible on the ranked APFS box:
# `.gitmoduleſ` (trailing U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S) case-folds to
# `.gitmodules` and names the SAME inode, but `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` leaves
# U+017F untouched, so the fold arm alone misses it. The drifted base contract
# lists the long-s spelling, so the allowlist admits the write; only the
# device:inode arm -- fed RAW bytes because the gate reads the diff with
# core.quotePath=false -- refuses it. Two independent reverts green this: drop the

# arm stats a C-quoted literal (`".gitmodule\305\277"`) that names no file, so the

# a linter that never ran finds nothing too. Measured, with the linter replaced

# six near-miss cases, on a run where nothing was linted at all. The `|| true`
# that used to sit here is what made the two indistinguishable.

# So the linter must show it reached its own summary before any count is

# WHY THESE CASES RUN AGAINST THE REAL benchmark.json AND NOT THE SYNTHETIC
# CONTRACT. Sections A-D prove the enforcers' MECHANICS on a miniature track,
# which is right for mechanics and wrong for this: the property under test here
# is a fact about THIS repository's declared surface. A synthetic contract would

# --- H. the head surface: CODE is editable, WEIGHTS never are ----------------

# pinned target checkpoint. There is no drafter to stage and no organizer head
# artifact to fetch, so `mtp-head/` holds no weight file and the DFlash arm is
# gone entirely (David ruling 2026-08-27, "Remove it, MTP-only").
#
# What must NEVER appear is a head WEIGHTS directory in `editablePaths`.
# `mtp-head/` and `dflash-head/` left that list under the 2026-08-26
# requant-only ruling, and re-granting either one would reopen the custom-head
# upload surface that ruling closed. Section F proves the surface gate refuses
# smuggled head bytes; this proves the manifest still declines to invite them.
#
# The model files that decide the head's geometry are NOT in this tree any
# more: the engine is the Vendor/mlx-swift-lm submodule, and a gitlink is not
# an editable path. Whether a submission may repoint that gitlink is an open
# ruling (runner contract section 14 item 3).

# --- J. the docs may not describe a DISK re-quantization -------------------
#
# A re-quantization happens ON LOAD, in memory (David clarification
# 2026-08-26). The mechanism was previously documented as a hook that REWROTE
# the staged head directory, and that framing survived in several places after
# the mechanism changed -- including inside the same file whose section 4.4
# states the on-load truth. A contradiction in the participant contract is worse
# than a gap: a participant who follows the stale half writes into a staged head
# and is refused by the sandbox and by the write-divergence gate.
#
# So the phrasing class is REFUSED here, not merely fixed once. Each needle
# below is a disk-artifact claim: something is produced, written, or uploaded.
# The prose is free to say a re-quantization happens on the benchmark machine --
# it does -- but not that a FILE is made there.
