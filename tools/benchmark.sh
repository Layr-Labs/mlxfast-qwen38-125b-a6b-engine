#!/usr/bin/env bash
# benchmark.sh — the benchd FACADE impersonating the Swift reference benchmark.sh.
#
# RELOCATED COPY. This file used to live at benchd/scripts/benchmark.sh inside the
# benchd SOURCE submodule. The submodule is gone: benchd now ships as a pinned
# PREBUILT benchd (./tools/fetch-benchd.sh, channel-resolved), so there is no
# benchd/ checkout for the facade to live in and it is vendored here instead.
# Its UPSTREAM is mlxfast-bench scripts/benchmark.sh at the pinned commit
# (the dist manifest's `source_commit`); the body below is that file verbatim apart from two
# edits near "Dispatch to benchd": the BENCHD resolution, which now resolves the
# pinned binary instead of trusting whatever `benchd` is on PATH, and the
# MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_TRACK_ID export, which benchd iterate requires and which this
# engine repository exported nowhere. Port changes from
# upstream rather than diverging here — the reference-parity comments below cite
# the Swift reference by line and are only true of the upstream bytes.
#
# This drop-in stands in, byte-for-byte on the observable shell contract, for the
# Swift reference:
#   ~/projects/layr-labs/mlxfast-challenge-dev/benchmark.sh
# (canonical, byte-identical across sibling checkouts). It does NOT re-implement the
# reference's transform / sandbox / weights-staging / cool-gate-polling machinery —
# `benchd iterate` owns the real run (spawns the MLX engine, runs correctness +
# timing, seals the score.json payload to stdout, writes <score>.sha256 and the
# per-mode benchmark-integrity sidecar). The facade only reproduces the observable
# SHELL contract around that run and then ADDS the human summary to stderr.
#
# Observable behaviors reproduced byte-for-byte from the reference (line cites are
# into the reference benchmark.sh):
#   - Arg parsing / mode selection, ref lines 25-138: the --weights/--golden/
#     --score-path shell-level rejection, --official / --local-cool-gate-only shell
#     selectors, the --official+local and --local-iterate+--local-submit combination
#     errors, and the "no mode given; defaulting to --local-iterate" STDOUT line.
#   - Golden preflight, ref lines 81-106: the missing-MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH
#     heredoc and the golden-file-not-found two-liner. SHAPE is reproduced (same
#     conditions, same exit codes, same stream); the TEXT deliberately diverges --
#     the upstream strings name Qwen artifacts and told a participant of THIS track
#     to go find a "provisioned Qwen3.6 golden outside correctness_prompts/", which
#     is wrong here. They now name this track's target and the checked-in public
#     goldens. Nothing diffs these two messages against the reference (the byte-parity
#     bar applies to the no-mode STDOUT line at ref 75, noted below).
#   - Score/integrity path derivation, ref lines 92-138.
#   - The end-of-run human summary on STDERR: report_local_baseline_context
#     (ref 179-205) + report_local_score_summary (ref 219-295), reusing the reference
#     jq programs VERBATIM so the summary block is byte-identical.
#
# Every message keeps the literal `benchmark.sh:` prefix on purpose — the facade
# impersonates benchmark.sh; it does NOT rename messages to its own filename.
#
# --official is a FULL-PARITY surface (R22): like the reference, the facade runs
# --official anywhere it is given a pinned correctness golden. official mode routes to
# `benchd iterate --mode official` (transform-verified weights, correctness vs the
# supplied golden, cool gate ON operator-side, timed, sealed) — the SAME methodology the
# reference runs. `MLXFAST_BENCHMARK_SKIP_TIMED=1` (with `MLXFAST_BENCHMARK_CHECK_GATES=1`)
# makes it a GATES-ONLY seam-1 run producing a `partial_result=true` gates-score. The
# "private oracle" is just the supplied correctness golden INPUT (real ones come from R2 —
# read-only, sha256+bytes pin-verified before use); `MLXFAST_PRIVATE_DIR` is only a sandbox
# DENY rule, never a dependency. official mode's hard requirements are sandbox-on +
# runtime-worker (enforce_official_sandbox, byte-matched to the reference).
#
# Facade-specific behaviors (NOT in the reference; the reference had its own engine):
#   - MLXFAST_ENGINE_BIN must point at the MLX engine binary benchd spawns.
#   - Exit-code mapping: benchd usage/bad-args is native 2; the facade maps 2 -> 1
#     to match the reference (which uses exit 1 for usage). 0 and 1 pass through.

benchmark.sh: this track requires an explicit correctness golden.

Set MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH. There is no default: a golden is never
selected implicitly. For a local run, use a checked-in public fixture --

  --local-iterate  correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_1024_256.json
  --local-submit   correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_1024_1024.json

Both public fixtures were generated under the GEMMA 4 tokenizer and carry
Gemma provenance. The pinned target is
Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP (model_type qwen4_exp_text), so the
model-identity golden loader REJECTS them. That refusal is correct and it
stands until the goldens are regenerated on ranked hardware
(docs/qwen38-125b-a6b-port-notes.md section 5.3).
Official (--official) runs take an organizer-provisioned hidden golden
instead; those are not in this repository.
