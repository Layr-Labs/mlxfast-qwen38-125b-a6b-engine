# ranked-box-preflight.sh -- the fail-closed gate the ranked job runs BEFORE
# ./setup.sh and before any measurement, for track qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR. The ranked job holds NO CREDENTIAL by design (bundles-no-keys:
# a box receives staged bundles, never keys), so the hidden material this track
# measures against cannot be fetched by the job itself -- it is staged onto the
# box out of band by the organizer. That moves the whole question from "can we
# download it" to "is what is on this box the pinned material". This script
# answers that question, and refuses when the answer is anything other than
# "yes, exactly".
#
# Every check below aborts before a score.json could exist. There is no
# degraded mode: the alternative to a verified staged asset is a non-zero exit,
# never a substituted, defaulted, or re-fetched one.
#
# THE STAGING CONVENTION IS THE EXISTING ONE, not a new one. The golden path
# comes from the runner process environment under the name
# tools/qwen38-125b-a6b-measure-and-score.sh already reads:
#
#   MLXFAST_QWEN38_GOLDEN_DIR          directory holding the 8 timed-pool tapes
#                                      (the live golden this leg scores over
#                                      among them)
#
# On a self-hosted runner it is set in the runner service environment by whoever
# stages the box; a `run:` step inherits it. Nothing here reads a GitHub secret,
# and nothing here reaches the network.
#
# PAIRED, WITH A PER-BOX BAND (David 2026-09-08). This track scores TWO legs on
# the same box in the same job, over the ONE live golden: a SERIAL-CONTROL leg
# on the organizer-staged reference tree and the CANDIDATE leg on the submission
# tree at its declared depth. The score is the LIVE ratio. Nothing stores a
# pair -- not the constants, not the fixture, not the golden. So this preflight
# verifies the staged pool tapes (and the live golden among them), the fixture
# arm state, AND the two names the paired path needs on this box:
#
#   MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE     the built reference tree, at the fixture's
#                                  baseline_reference_commit;
#   MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION   this box's health band for the control leg.
#
# Section 6 holds both. Nothing here fetches or builds the reference tree: it is
# staged on the box out of band, the same way the goldens are.
#
# WHAT THE PINS ARE. fixtures/qwen3_8_125b_a6b_track.json is trusted-side (not an
# editable path), and its timed_prompt_pool[] carries {r2_path, sha256, bytes}
# per tape plus hidden_correctness_golden's {sha256, bytes}. A staged file is
# accepted only when its byte count AND its sha256 equal the contract's -- byte
# count first, because a truncated stage is the common failure and naming it
# precisely is worth one `wc -c` (the same order tools/fetch-goldens.sh and
# tools/fetch-benchd.sh verify in).

#                                     benchd development) -- so on a ranked run
#                                     it is a way to measure against unpinned
#                                     scoring code.
#   MLXFAST_SKIP_WEIGHTS_DOWNLOAD /   setup.sh builds tools only and never

#   MLXFAST_LOCAL_COOL_GATE           disables the thermal gate.
#   MLXFAST_LOCAL_ALLOW_GOLDEN_DRIFT  publishes a timing estimate past a failed
#                                     public correctness gate.

#                                     reader with an arbitrary shell command --
#                                     it is the FIRST branch of benchd's reader
#                                     discovery, ahead of MLXFAST_MACMON_BIN, so
#                                     `echo 20` set here would make every cool
#                                     gate pass instantly on a hot GPU.
#   BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET      names an ALREADY-LOADED resident. The
#                                     paired run boots ONE resident PER LEG, and
#                                     benchd boots each from that leg's own
