# Revert-proof for tools/stage-bench-worker.sh and its wiring into setup.sh.
#
# benchd resolves the scored worker at .build/release/bench-worker and
# loads mlx.metallib from that SAME directory. The worker is built in an isolated
# scratch root (.build-worker/release) with its metallib beside it, so setup.sh
# stages the finished set into .build/release. This suite asserts that staging
# actually lands that set -- binary, its sibling metallib AND the metallib's
# fingerprint sidecar -- at the benchd-resolved path, and that setup.sh invokes
# the staging step on both of its exit paths. It goes RED if the staging fix is
# reverted: the copy stops, the metallib or its sidecar is dropped, or the
# setup.sh call is removed.
#
# The sidecar matters because the harness reads the fingerprint record at
# <staged metallib>.fingerprint. A metallib staged without it fails that check
# with "no fingerprint record", which an official run treats as fatal, so a
# metallib present with no sidecar is a refusal here rather than a skip.
#
# Hermetic: no weights, no GPU, no network, no toolchain, no box. Each case copies
# the REAL tool into a throwaway repo root so its ROOT_DIR resolves there, then
# drives it with stub files under $TMPDIR.
