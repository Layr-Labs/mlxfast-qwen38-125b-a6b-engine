# fetch-benchd.sh -- resolve the `benchd` measurement harness from its release
# channel.
#
# THE PIN IS REMOVED (David ruling 2026-08-27). benchd used to be frozen here by
# ./benchd.pin ({branch, commit, sha256, bytes}), which made every benchd bug
# fix require an engine-repo pin-advance commit before it could reach a box --
# the depth/echo fix sat merged in the bench repo while the served pin still
# carried the bug. That coupling is gone: this repository names only the CHANNEL
# (the bench repo + branch), and the channel's tip is what runs. Fixing a
# measurement bug is now: merge it bench-side, republish dist, done -- zero
# engine commits.
#
# WHAT REPLACES THE PIN'S GUARANTEES, stated honestly:
#
#   * INTEGRITY (the bytes are what the organizer published): the dist channel
#     publishes `benchd.manifest.json` next to the binary ({branch,
#     source_commit, sha256, bytes}, written by the bench repo's
#     scripts/build-dist.sh). The binary is verified against THAT manifest --
#     fetched from the same organizer-controlled channel -- and nothing
#     unverified is ever installed or returned. What this no longer defends
#     against is the channel itself moving, which is the point: the channel is
#     the organizer's bench repo, participants cannot write to it, and its tip
#     is now the intended source of truth.
#   * PROVENANCE (knowing which benchd measured a run): recorded, not pinned.
#     The resolved {branch, source_commit, sha256} is logged loudly on every
#     resolve and the manifest is installed beside the binary
#     (benchd-bin/benchd.manifest.json), so any run's harness identity can be
#     read off the box afterwards.
#   * SUBMISSION-PROOFNESS: unchanged. This script and the channel constants
#     live under tools/, outside editablePaths, and the manifest linter
#     (FORBIDDEN_EDITABLE) still forbids `benchd.pin`/`benchd-bin` spellings,
#     so a submission can neither redirect the fetch nor resurrect a pin.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, in order:
#   1. If benchd-bin/benchd AND benchd-bin/benchd.manifest.json exist and
#      agree (sha256 + bytes), use them, never touching the network -- the
#      OFFLINE path: the ranked box gets both files placed together. A binary
#      with no manifest, or a pair that disagrees, refuses loudly (a bare
#      unattributable binary is exactly what this script must never run).
#      Set BENCHD_REFRESH=1 to discard the local pair and re-resolve the
#      channel tip.
#   2. Otherwise obtain the PAIR -- from BENCHD_DIST_LOCAL (file/dir, for
#      air-gapped boxes) or by downloading manifest-then-binary from the
#      channel -- verify the binary against its manifest, and install both.
#
# Prints the absolute path of the verified binary on STDOUT (diagnostics go to
# stderr), so callers can do:  BENCHD="$(./tools/fetch-benchd.sh)"
#
# Env:
#   BENCHD_BRANCH       channel branch. Default: qwen3.8-125b-a6b-v1.
#                       THE BRANCH IS THE PROJECT, NOT THE TRACK. David ruling
#                       2026-08-27: the MLX and CUDA tracks of this model share
#                       ONE bench release branch and ONE dist channel, because
#                       they share one benchmarker. The TRACK id stays
#                       platform-specific (qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1) and is what
#                       names the leaderboard namespace, the runner labels and
#                       the R2 prefix. Do not conflate the two: this variable
#                       and the manifest branch check are the only places the
#                       PROJECT name belongs.
#   BENCHD_BIN_DIR      install directory. Default: <repo>/benchd-bin
#                       (gitignored; a fetched artifact, not repository content).
#   BENCHD_REFRESH      set to 1 to discard an already-installed pair and
#                       re-resolve the channel tip.
#   BENCHD_DIST_LOCAL   path to an already-obtained dist (a directory holding
#                       benchd + benchd.manifest.json, or the benchd file
#                       with the manifest beside it). Verified, never trusted
#                       bare.
#   BENCHD_DIST_BASE_URL
#                       raw host + repo prefix. Default:
#                       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layr-Labs/mlxfast-bench
#                       -- the bench repository, which is where this track's
#                       release branch and dist channel live. It is the
#                       organizer's repository: participants cannot write to it.
#   BENCHD_DIST_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN
#                       bearer token for a private channel repo.
