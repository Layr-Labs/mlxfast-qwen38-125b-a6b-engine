#
# new-track.sh -- stamp a NEW track into a freshly seeded engine repository.
#
# Run this from the ROOT of a fresh seed: a tree-identical copy of this
# repository's tip, made the way docs/new-track-repo-procedure.md section 1
# describes (one signed commit, no history). The seed still carries the SOURCE
# track's identity everywhere -- the manifest, the contract fixture, the runner
# label, the docs, the checkpoint pin. This script replaces that identity with
# the new track's, in one pass, so the stamped tree is internally consistent
# and the repository's own checks still pass.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/new-track.sh --track-id <{model}{ver}-{params}-{platform}-v{N}> \
#                      --fork-sha <40 hex> \
#                      --checkpoint <hf_repo>@<40 hex revision> \
#                      [--bench-commit <40 hex>] \
#                      [--os macOS|Linux] \
#                      [--hash-non-lfs]
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it never commits, never pushes, and never touches the
# network except for the Hugging Face tree read that pins the checkpoint. The
# operator reviews the working tree and commits.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO: it copies MODEL FACTS from the template. The new fixture's
# layer counts, head widths, expert counts, MoE geometry and n-gram shape are
# the SOURCE model's, and they are wrong for any different model family. The
# script prints this loudly at the end; re-authoring them is the operator's
# first job after stamping.
