#
# test-benchmark-facade-env.sh -- the benchd facade exports the track id.
#
# `benchd iterate` REQUIRES MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_TRACK_ID in every mode (its
# `-{platform}-v{N}` suffix keys the official baseline pair; the official path
# resolves it before the gates-only branch), and this repository once exported
# it nowhere, so `./benchmark.sh --local-iterate` and `--official` both refused
# with "no track_id". tools/benchmark.sh now reads benchmark.json's `trackId`
# and exports it before dispatch. This suite pins that, by driving the REAL
# facade with a STUB benchd that records the environment and argv it was
# spawned with. Hermetic: no toolchain, weights, GPU, benchd binary or network.
#
# Cases:
#   1. --local-iterate: the stub sees MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_TRACK_ID == benchmark.json
#      trackId, non-empty, on an `iterate --mode local-iterate` argv.
#   2. --official (gates-only env): the same export on `--mode official`.
#   3. a manifest with NO trackId: the facade refuses (exit 1, names the field)
#      and benchd is never spawned.
#   4. a caller pre-sets a DIFFERENT MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_TRACK_ID: refused, never
#      overridden, benchd never spawned.
#   5. a caller pre-sets the SAME value: accepted.
#
# It then pins the RANKED path's WINDOW wiring on
# tools/qwen38-125b-a6b-measure-and-score.sh, with a stub bench-worker that
# binds a socket and answers a hello the way the real resident does:
#   6. THE RANKED PATH BOOTS NO RESIDENT AND EXPORTS NO SOCKET. It used to boot
#      one from the CANDIDATE tree and hand benchd the socket; under the paired
#      design the REFERENCE leg then attached to the candidate's resident and
#      was refused (public run 34230122059). benchd boots one resident PER LEG
#      now, from that leg's own tree, so the measure script must hand it
#      nothing -- and it must still take the GPU lock, because the box needs one
#      loader whoever boots it.
#   7. an INHERITED BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET is refused by name, and benchd
#      is never dispatched: a socket arriving through the runner service
#      environment would reproduce the same failure.
#   8. --preflight-only boots no resident and takes no lock: a pre-GPU dry run
#      loads nothing, so it must not open a GPU window.
#
# Cases 9-13 pin the PAIRED plumbing (David ruling 2026-09-08). A ranked run
# measures a serial-control leg on the organizer's reference tree and a
# candidate leg on this checkout, and the score is the LIVE ratio:
#   9.  the dispatch carries --baseline-workspace and --baseline-calibration
#       from MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE / MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION, and
#       --engine is RELATIVE to the checkout root, because benchd re-roots that
#       path under the reference workspace to find the control leg's worker.
#   10. MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE unset: refused by name, benchd never spawned.
#   11. MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION unset: refused by name, benchd never spawned.
#   12. --preflight-only does NOT require either: it is benchmark.json's
#       preSubmitCommand, which a participant runs off the box.
#   13. an engine OUTSIDE the checkout is refused: it has no relative form, so
#       the control leg would run the candidate's own binary.
#   14. a WEIGHTS directory outside the checkout is refused for the same reason:
#       the control leg would read the candidate's own transform.
#   15. --box is passed ONLY when RUNNER_NAME is absent. benchd lets RUNNER_NAME
#       win over the flag, so on a runner the flag is dead argv; on a hand run
#       it is the only box identity benchd has, and it comes from the
#       calibration file's own `box`.
