#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Stage this package's `track-bench-worker` (which links the editable Runner) and its
# mlx.metallib into the location benchd resolves.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. benchd resolves the scored engine at a FIXED
# workspace-relative path -- <workspace>/.build/release/bench-worker -- and
# Metal loads mlx.metallib from the SAME directory as the running binary (Cmlx
# searches next to the executable). The worker is BUILT under its own SwiftPM
# scratch root (.build-worker) so a participant-code compile can never write
# into the trusted CLI's .build tree, and mlx.metallib is emitted next to that
# scratch binary (.build-worker/release/mlx.metallib). The build output and
# benchd's resolver therefore land in different directories, and the metallib
# is not beside the binary benchd launches -- so a run either fails to find the
# engine or finds one with no metallib and dies at its first MLXArray.
#
# This step copies the FINISHED SET -- the engine binary, its mlx.metallib and
# the metallib's fingerprint sidecar -- from the scratch root into
# .build/release, as siblings. Only this trusted step performs the copy, and it
# runs AFTER the build, so the scratch-root build isolation is preserved.
#
# THE FINGERPRINT SIDECAR TRAVELS WITH THE METALLIB. tools/build-mlx-metallib.sh
# writes mlx.metallib.fingerprint beside every metallib it publishes, and the
# ranked workflow (.github/workflows/benchmark.yml) awk-reads the record out of
# that sidecar and compares it against `tools/build-mlx-metallib.sh
# --print-fingerprint` for this checkout, both on the build-cache hit and when
# it adopts a pre-staged library; setup.sh requires the sidecar to be present
# beside a pre-staged metallib before it skips the Metal toolchain. Staging the
# metallib without its sidecar therefore turns a passing compare into a hard
# refusal in both places. So the sidecar is copied with the pair, and a metallib
# that arrives without one is a REFUSAL, not a skip: a silently absent sidecar
# is indistinguishable there from a tampered one.
