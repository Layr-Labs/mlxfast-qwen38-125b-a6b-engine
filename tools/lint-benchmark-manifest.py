"""Lint benchmark.json -- the Yukon track manifest for this repository.

Yukon reads benchmark.json to import the track, overlay a submission's editable
surface onto a trusted checkout, and dispatch setup / pre-submit / benchmark. Every
one of those steps fails at RUN time on a manifest that is merely wrong at REST, so
this linter turns the rest-state properties into a check that runs in CI.

What it asserts, in order:

  1. schema keys        every key the live manifest carries is present, with the
                        right JSON type.
  2. editable paths     every editablePaths / optionalEditablePaths entry EXISTS in
                        the tree, optionalEditablePaths is a subset of editablePaths,
                        and no entry is a duplicate or is nested inside another.
  3. gitlink exclusion  no editable entry covers benchd/, .gitmodules, benchd.pin or
                        benchd-bin/ at ANY prefix depth, and tools/fetch-benchd.sh
                        exists.
                        LOAD-BEARING: benchd is the measurement harness --
                        a PREBUILT benchd resolved from the bench repository's
                        dist channel and verified against that channel's own
                        benchd.manifest.json -- and an editable entry over the
                        resolver or the resolved binary would let a submission
                        repoint the thing that scores it. The submodule and pin
                        spellings are kept so a reintroduced gitlink or a planted
                        pin file is covered on arrival.
  3b. byte budget       every editableSurfaceByteBudget cap is a positive integer, the
                        per-file cap can bind, and the enforcer's fallback constants
                        still equal the declared caps (manifest/enforcer drift).
  3c. trust boundary    no editable entry OVERLAPS a fixed set of trust-boundary paths:
                        the trusted-harness/CLI/core sources (Package.swift,
                        Package.resolved, Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness,
                        Sources/MLXFastCLI, Sources/MLXFastCore), the gate machinery
                        (.github, tools), the track contract + pinned artifact
                        manifests (fixtures), and this manifest's own filename
                        (benchmark.json) -- the benchd pin paths are the ONE
                        exception, bound separately and more exhaustively by check 3. Interim,
                        rest-state form of upstream's
                        verify_contract_does_not_expose_trusted_scope; the general
                        run-time form is still deferred.
  4. commands           setup / preSubmit / benchmark commands are ["bash","-c",...],
                        and every repo-relative script token in them exists and is
                        executable. benchmarkCommand must set MLXFAST_SCORE_PATH equal
                        to scorePath (the facade's --local-iterate default differs).
  5. contractPath       exists, parses as JSON, and its track_id matches trackId.
  5b. golden pair       NO golden file carries
                        benchmark.baseline_prefill_seconds_per_token or
                        benchmark.baseline_decode_seconds_per_token. The scored
                        pair is MEASURED live on the ranked box (serial-control
                        leg + candidate leg, David ruling 2026-09-08), so a
                        stored baseline is a stale denominator from another box.
  5c. reference commit  contractPath declares baseline_reference_commit as a
                        40-hex engine commit -- the tree MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE
                        must be at, which tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh enforces.
  6. scoring constants  match the PINNED constants for this manifest's OWN trackId
                        (EXPECTED_SCORING_BY_TRACK -- a per-track registry, not one
                        global expectation: qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1 and
                        qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1 are ruled differently and neither's
                        pins apply to the other), and agree with the contract
                        fixture's scoring_semantics where both state a value, and
                        the fixture's official_pairs, decode_speedup_floor and
                        prefill_speedup_floor (the values benchd enforces).
                        A manifest value ruled AHEAD of the pinned benchd is
                        NOT machine-cross-checked against benchd here -- benchd is a
                        prebuilt binary now, not a source tree this linter could
                        grep, so a check of that shape has nowhere to read from. The honest, load-bearing
                        instrument for that class of drift is
                        docs/qwen38-125b-a6b-port-notes.md (benchmark.json
                        and its contract fixture carry values only, no prose
                        fields, per David's 2026-08-24 ruling), not a linter
                        check.
  7. runner             runner.workflow resolves to a real file under
                        .github/workflows/.

Usage:  python3 tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py [--repo-root DIR] [--manifest PATH]
                                                [--gitlink-targets require|report]
Exit:   0 all checks pass, 1 one or more failures (each printed with a FAIL prefix).

--gitlink-targets report downgrades a command target that is missing ONLY
because its submodule is not checked out to an UNVERIFIED line instead of a
FAIL. NO COMMAND TARGET IS INSIDE A SUBMODULE ANY MORE: benchd stopped being a
source submodule when it became a pinned prebuilt, and every command target now
lives in this repository (./setup.sh, ./tools/fetch-benchd.sh,
./tools/qwen38-125b-a6b-measure-and-score.sh), so the downgrade currently applies to
nothing and all three commands are fully verified in CI. The flag is kept for
the next submodule, not removed as dead.

# --- per-track scoring-constant registry ------------------------------------
#
# RE-AIMED 2026-08-24 (reviewer blocker on the qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1 manifest
# PR, orchestrator-adopted): this used to be ONE global EXPECTED_SCORING dict,
# hardcoded to the qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1 ruling, that every manifest's `scoring`
# block was checked against regardless of track. That was never actually
# universal -- it just had exactly one registrant -- and it broke the instant
# a second, honestly differently-scored track (qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1's
# batched-cohort composite, vs. qwen's per-prompt median) existed to check.
#
# THE FIX IS THE STRUCTURE, NOT A WEAKER CHECK: each track pins its own
# constants under its own trackId key below, and check_scoring looks up the
# CURRENT manifest's trackId. A track with a registered entry is checked
# EXACTLY as strictly as qwen's ever was -- the qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1 entry below
# is byte-for-byte the content of the old global EXPECTED_SCORING dict, so
# every qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1 manifest that passed this check before passes it
# identically now (verified: re-running this linter against a manifest with
# trackId=qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1 and the old field values exercises the exact same
# key/value assertions, in the exact same fail/ok wording, as before this
# change). A track with NO registered entry is not silently waved through --
# see check_scoring's `expected is None` branch, which prints an explicit
# "no registered pin set" line rather than staying silent, so a future new
# track shows up as a visible gap instead of a quiet pass.

# QWEN3.8-125B-A6B-MLX-V1 sources -- each value pinned here (not read from
# the fixture at check time, the same posture qwen's dict above always used)
# because each is either David's own ruling or a benchd source constant this
# repository's manifest independently pins to and documents:
#   mode
#       mlxfast-bench crates/benchd/src/overlay.rs `SCORING_MODE`, which is
#       the same string as measure_job.rs `MEASURE_JOB_MODE`: benchd's
#       SINGLE-STREAM paired regime name. It replaced
#       `COHORT_MEASURE_JOB_MODE` on 2026-08-27, when David ruled this track
#       single-stream ("Single-stream only": composite over a paired
#       serial-against-MTP single-stream series, scored_batch_size 1, and no
#       ContinuousBatchingV2 adaptation). Both names are read off benchd
#       source, never invented here -- an earlier manifest revision carried an
#       invented label benchd never emits, which is why this field is pinned
#       at all. A mismatch here is always an authoring error, never a
#       legitimate temporary state, so it has NO caveat-based warn path.
#   scoredBatchSize = 1
#       RULED by David 2026-08-27 with the mode above. THIS IS A
#       RULED-AHEAD-OF-PIN VALUE, like pairsPerCohort below: at the published
#       channel tip `ScoredBatchPoint::certify` certifies B = 8 only, so a
#       fixture declaring 1 is REFUSED at that width certification until the
#       bench lane lands the single-stream regime. The refusal is
#       fail-closed and correct; this repository declares the ruled shape and
#       does not work around it. docs/participant-contract.md section 5.1 and
#       section 11.4 carry the same statement.
#   scoredBatchSize / kvBackend / decodeSpeedupFloor / decodeSpeedupCeiling /
#   scoredExponents
#       benchmark.json scoring.* (this repo's own manifest); each field's
#       citation to the ruling and/or the benchd constant it certifies
#       against (ScoredBatchPoint::certify / SCORED_BATCH_SIZE_B8,
#       ScoredExponents::certify, kv_backend) lives in
#       docs/participant-contract.md section 5, not in the manifest itself
#       (benchmark.json and its contract fixture carry values only, no prose
#       fields, per David's 2026-08-24 ruling -- see
#       docs/qwen38-125b-a6b-port-notes.md for the full split).
#   pairsPerCohort / minPairsPerCohort -- NOT PINNED HERE, CONFIGURABLE
#       The count is a track setting, not a constant: it is whatever the track
#       fixture declares as official_pairs (2 today, David 2026-09-09 ("move to 2 pairs on both mlx and cuda for
#       now"; "1 pair is not sufficient"), superseding the 2026-08-26 ruling of
#       4 that was written for the Gemma batched cohort and never read on this
#       track's paired path. THE ENFORCED VALUE LIVES IN THE TRACK FIXTURE:
#       benchd reads `official_pairs` from the --contract fixture and refuses a
#       ranked run whose fixture does not declare it. benchmark.json carries the
#       same number for readers, and check_scoring below fails when the two
#       disagree, so the manifest can never say one count while the box runs
#       another. Each pair is one serial-control leg on the reference tree and
#       one candidate leg; per role the per-token times are summed over the
#       pairs and the score is the ratio of the sums.
#   decodeSpeedupFloor / prefillSpeedupFloor -- NOT PINNED HERE, CONFIGURABLE
#       The floors are 0.95 on BOTH axes (David 2026-09-09): a candidate that
#       regresses either axis by more than 5 % is refused. They are track
#       settings, like the pair count, and the enforced values live in the track
#       fixture as `decode_speedup_floor` and `prefill_speedup_floor`.
#       benchmark.json carries the same two numbers for readers, and
#       check_scoring below fails when the two files disagree. The earlier
#       0.90 decode floor and the absent prefill floor were authoring errors:
#       0.90 is the qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1 free-run constant and never governed

# `benchd` and `.gitmodules` named the SOURCE SUBMODULE that used to measure a

# repository's dist channel into ./benchd-bin/ by tools/fetch-benchd.sh -- so

# time the target is present.
#
# `Vendor/mlx-swift-lm` is the LIVE gitlink: the engine fork is a submodule
# pinned by commit. A gitlink names a commit, not bytes in this tree, so an
# editable entry over it would let a submission move the engine to a commit

# (TRUSTED_SCOPE_FILES + TRUSTED_SCOPE_DIRS), which runs the same assertion at
# dispatch time against the trusted ref.
#
# Sources/MLXFastTransform is deliberately NOT here: it is participant-editable
# by contract. The engine itself is no longer a source tree in this repository
# -- it is the Vendor/mlx-swift-lm submodule, held out of the editable surface
# by FORBIDDEN_EDITABLE above -- so there is no sandboxed participant-facing
# source directory left for this scope to argue about.
#
# `.github` and `tools` are a DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from upstream's roster,
# which omits both -- ruled by David 2026-08-20: "parity doctrine governs
# measurement surfaces, not security posture." The gates themselves live in
# those two directories (the overlay, the static review, the surface gate, this
# linter, the hostile-archive suite, the CI tripwires). A contract that could
# declare them editable would let a submission rewrite the machinery that judges
# it, which is the same failure the other five entries exist to prevent; that
# the reference roster predates this repository's gates being there is not a
# reason to leave them unclaimed. Divergences from upstream are normally debt --
# this one is not, and must not be "reconciled" back to five.

# refused only by Yukon itself -- src/benchmark/manifest.ts rejects an
# editablePaths entry literally equal to "benchmark.json" at parse time, and
# nothing in this repository's own tooling refused a `fixtures` entry at all.
# That is a real gap: a future manifest edit widening editablePaths to cover
# either is a one-line change an author could make without this linter, CI's
# only local defense, ever objecting -- exactly the "quietly widen the surface

#
# It did not: maxTotalBytes was raised to 4404587 in the manifest and in the

# linter passed clean across that gap for a day. A shell fallback BELOW the
# declaration is a latent false-reject (static review refuses a submission the
# contract says fits); one ABOVE it admits bytes the contract does not. Neither
# direction is submission-reachable -- a submission cannot edit either enforcer
# -- so this is a consistency gate, not a hole being closed; the reason to hold

        SEMANTICS, stated rather than inherited -- an editable entry overlaps a

        The separator is appended before the prefix test, so a sibling whose
        name merely starts with a scope path -- Sources/MLXFastCoreExtras,
        Package.swift.bak -- does NOT overlap. This is the same relation as

          * casefold, because the ranked box is macOS and APFS is

            directory;
          * filesystem identity over each side's ancestors against the WHOLE
            other path, for the spellings ASCII folding does not reach.

        BOTH SIDES GO THROUGH _normalize() FIRST, so the lexical arm compares
        the same segment join that _prefixes() builds. Without that they
        disagreed, and the disagreement was exploitable: `sources//mlxfastcore`
        folded to a string matching neither `==` nor `startswith`, and the
        samefile arm cannot rescue a wrong-case spelling on the case-SENSITIVE
        hosted lint runner -- which is the only place this check runs
        automatically. The lexical arm is the binding arm there, so it is the
        arm that has to be spelling-proof.

        Ancestor-to-ancestor identity is deliberately NOT tested:
        Sources/MLXFastTransform and Sources/MLXFastCore share the ancestor
        `Sources`, and comparing those would refuse every legitimate entry.

        The interim, REST-STATE half of upstream's
        verify_contract_does_not_expose_trusted_scope
        (verify-trusted-source-scope.sh@bfab0de:123-139). Upstream runs the
        general form at dispatch, reading the contract from the trusted ref and
        byte-comparing the whole scope; that general form is deferred here along
        with the rest of the runner provisioning (docs/submission-restriction-spec.md
        section 9). This check binds the one property that can be decided at rest
        and in CI: the contract in the tree must not DECLARE trusted surface
        editable in the first place.

        TRUSTED_SCOPE is broader than its original name suggested: alongside the
        trusted-harness/CLI/core sources it also binds `fixtures` (the track
        contract this very check reads, plus the pinned reference/head byte
        manifests) and `benchmark.json` (this manifest's own filename -- Yukon's
        own schema already refuses that one specific string at parse time, but
        this repository's own gate should not depend solely on the platform
        catching it). The benchd pin paths are the one deliberate exception:
        check_gitlink_excluded (3) already binds them, with case-folding and
        filesystem-identity handling this generic relation does not duplicate.

        Scope is checked against editablePaths, optionalEditablePaths AND
        editableSurfaceByteBudget.exemptPaths, all three by the same overlap
        relation -- exemptPaths is not exempt from THIS check, it only exempts
