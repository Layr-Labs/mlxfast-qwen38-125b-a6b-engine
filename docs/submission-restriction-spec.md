# Submission-restriction enforcement: extracted spec and parity notes

Issue #16. This document is the spec-extraction half of that issue: what the
ORIGINAL challenger implementation actually enforces about an untrusted
submission, rule by rule, with a citation for each; what this repository
re-implements; where the re-implementation deliberately differs; and which
questions in the original need an operator ruling before anything dispatches.

## 0. Provenance of every citation

The reference is the challenger repository, read-only:

```text
Layr-Labs/qwen-3.8-mtp-challenge   main @ bfab0de58d43453e506523707e1720a3485570f4
```

fetched 2026-08-20 into this repository as the `upstream` remote. Citations are
written `<path>@bfab0de:<line>` and every one is reproducible with:

```bash
git -C <engine-checkout> fetch upstream
git -C <engine-checkout> show upstream/main:<path> | sed -n '<line>p'
```

The offline ranked-box mirror in `b4-ranked-box-mirror/` carries an older
checkout (`1af12bc`, 2026-08-14) of the same tree. It was consulted only to
confirm the files exist there too; nothing in this document is cited from it,
because `upstream/main` is both newer and independently verifiable.

The two files this document extracts rule by rule — the gates that decide what
a submission may CONTAIN and how much of it — are:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift` | the byte-budget enforcer (upstream: launch-time; here it runs in the test suite only, see §1) |
| `.github/scripts/run-submission-static-review.sh` | pre-dispatch deterministic caps + LLM bypass judge |

`.github/scripts/hardened-git.sh` supports the static review. The in-repository
overlay and modifiable-surface gate that this document once extracted (R3, R4)
were retired on 2026-09-09: neither had a caller on any scoring path. Yukon's
service overlays the archive, and benchd enforces the surface at scoring (§1).

**These files are not the whole submission-restriction surface upstream.** At
least three further gates are load-bearing against a hostile submission and are
NOT extracted here; §9 records each as not-ported, with what it would cost to
be wrong about it:

| File | Role | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/scripts/verify-trusted-source-scope.sh` | trusted-source-scope re-verification immediately before the trusted build | carries the GENERAL form of this repository's A1: `verify_contract_does_not_expose_trusted_scope@bfab0de:117-139` refuses any `editablePaths` entry overlapping the trusted scope, read from the TRUSTED ref. A1 protects one pair of paths (`benchd`, `.gitmodules`) by construction; this protects the whole trusted scope. This repository now carries the REST-STATE half as linter check 3c (same overlap relation, whole trusted scope, runs in CI); the run-time half — trusted-ref contract read plus byte-identity re-verification of the scope before the trusted build — is deferred to runner provisioning. See §9. |
| `.github/scripts/pin-trusted-harness.sh` | content pins over the built trusted and worker artifacts | binds every scored phase to the binaries built from the reviewed source, so a submitted transform cannot rewrite the worker after the build |
| `.github/scripts/deny-private-artifacts.sh` | artifact/cache upload refusal | bounds exfiltration of hidden prompts, goldens and shards through the artifact channel |

The earlier revision of this section claimed the four-file table was the whole
surface. It was false, and the fail-closed reading is the one written above:
treat the extracted four as a floor, not a boundary. Nothing in §§2-5 depends on
the difference — those sections cite the four files directly — but §1's gate
list is likewise a statement about what this repository re-implements, not a
census of upstream.

## 1. Layer map

An untrusted submission passes three gates. One runs in this repository; the
other two are outside it. Each is fail-closed on its own; none is load-bearing
alone.

```text
archive ──► Yukon's overlay                REPLACE only editablePaths, read
            (Yukon's service)              from the trusted contract; an absent
                                           OPTIONAL path keeps the trusted copy
   │
   ├──────► static-review checks           per-file / total / growth byte caps,
            (this repository, hosted)      path validation, exempt handling
                                           ── then the LLM bypass judge
   │
   └──────► benchd, at scoring             refuses a candidate that diverges
            (the trust boundary)           from its baseline outside the surface
```

On a ranked dispatch the hosted `surface-check` job in
`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` runs the third gate. It runs
`tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py`, then
`.github/scripts/submission-static-review-checks.sh` in whole-surface mode,
which applies `maxTotalBytes` and `maxFileBytes` over the whole editable
surface. The ranked job needs `surface-check`, so a submission that fails it
never reaches a box.

The original enforces the byte caps a second time at launch:
`EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift@bfab0de:4-13` states that the judge applies the
policy but "these mechanical caps are the launch-time backstop that binds every
ranked worker launch path, including dispatches that never pass through the
review step."

**That second enforcement does not run here.** No command path and no workflow
path calls `verifyEditableSurfaceByteBudget`. The only caller is
`tools/editable-surface-budget-cli`, which `tools/test-submission-security.sh`
builds and runs, so the Swift verifier is exercised by the test suite only.
§9 records the launch-time call site as deferred to runner provisioning.

## 2. R1 — the byte budget

Source: `Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift@bfab0de:1-157`,
called from `Sources/MLXFastCLI/main.swift@bfab0de:2286` inside the runtime-worker
spawn preflight, implemented at `main.swift@bfab0de:2361-2397`.

| # | Rule | Original |
|---|---|---|
| R1.1 | Total editable surface ≤ 3,000,000 bytes | `bfab0de:18` |
| R1.2 | Any single editable file ≤ 524,288 bytes | `bfab0de:19` |
| R1.3 | Contract is `benchmark.json` next to the cwd | `bfab0de:20`, `main.swift@bfab0de:2362-2364` |
| R1.4 | Absent contract = `.skipped`; official runs treat that as fatal, local runs proceed | `bfab0de:57-59`, `main.swift@bfab0de:2380-2386` |
| R1.5 | Contract that does not parse, or carries no non-empty `editablePaths`, = `.exceeded` (fail closed) | `bfab0de:60-68` |
| R1.6 | Walk is rooted at the contract's own directory | `bfab0de:75` |
| R1.7 | Upstream: only regular files count; symlinks and other non-regular entries are SKIPPED, not rejected. DIVERGED here — a symlink at or under an editable path fails closed (D8) | `bfab0de:37-39`, `bfab0de:118-124`, `bfab0de:138-144` |
| R1.8 | A missing editable path is skipped silently; DIVERGED — a surface where EVERY path is absent (walks to zero files) fails closed (D8) | `bfab0de:115-117` |
| R1.9 | A directory that cannot be enumerated = `.exceeded` | `bfab0de:133-137` |
| R1.10 | `editableSurfaceByteBudget.exemptPaths` are held out of the CODE budget and charged to their own cap. **This track declares no `exemptPaths` since the requant-only ruling (2026-08-26), so the exempt arm is unreachable here.** The mechanism is retained in the enforcers and still tested against a synthetic contract | `bfab0de:41-50`, `bfab0de:70-73`, `bfab0de:98-109` |
| R1.11 | Exempt AGGREGATE cap defaults to 512,000,000 (David BYO-512 ruling 2026-08-26). It is still DECLARED and still drift-checked against both enforcers' fallbacks, and it cannot bind while `exemptPaths` is absent | `bfab0de:22-25` |
| R1.11a | Exempt PER-FILE cap defaults to 100,000,000 and is checked before the aggregate, so an oversize submitted blob names itself. Same status as R1.11: declared, drift-checked, unreachable while `exemptPaths` is absent. This cap is what refused the organizer's own monolithic 236 MB staged MTP head on the box before the head directories left `editablePaths` | added 2026-08-26 |
| R1.12 | The per-file cap is checked BEFORE the running total, so an oversized file names itself | `bfab0de:81-86` |
| R1.13 | The total is checked after each file, so the message says "at least N bytes" | `bfab0de:89-94` |
| R1.14 | Official run: `.exceeded` refuses the worker spawn; local run: warn on stderr and continue | `main.swift@bfab0de:2387-2396` |
| R1.15 | Env overrides `MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_STATIC_REVIEW_MAX_BYTES` / `_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, same knobs as the review script — **NOT ported; retired by ruling, see §8 Q9** | `main.swift@bfab0de:2365-2372` |

Why the exemption existed, in the original's own words
(`bfab0de:41-50`): head weights joined the competitive surface on 2026-08-14,
they are not source, a 3 MB source budget would make in-branch head delivery
unusable, and what bounds an exempt path instead is the digest + byte-count
verification of `mtp-head.manifest.json` done before the sandbox opens. The
lookup-table defence is untouched for every other path.

**THE EXEMPTION IS RETIRED ON THIS TRACK (David requant-only ruling,
2026-08-26).** In-branch head delivery is retired with it: no head weights
directory is an `editablePaths` entry, the head declaration accepts
`"source": "pinned"` only, and a submission carries no head weights. On this
track the head is embedded in the pinned target checkpoint, so nothing stages a
head artifact at all. There is therefore nothing left to exempt, and
`exemptPaths` is absent from this repository's contract. The paragraph above is
kept as the record of what the exemption was for.

**"Digest + byte-count" is the original's claim, not this repository's bound —
RATIFIED size-only (engine-alteration-blocks audit, 2026-08-21; DECIDE-2 Q-B).**
Here the digest half of that sentence is deliberately not a gate. That remains
true after the requant-only ruling, and it is now the sharpest open limit on the
track: `max_bytes` (2 GiB) is enforced fail-closed, and a declared `sha256` is
parsed and carried when present but neither required nor verified against the
head bytes
(`Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/Gemma4MTPHeadDeclaration.swift`, the
"DECIDE-2 Q-B" comment; the sealed record's `head_provenance` carries the
harness's own recomputed tree digest, never the declared value — see
`docs/qwen38-125b-a6b-port-notes.md` section 4.2). The compensating control
is not content identity but isolation: the measured leg runs the head inside
the box-enforced bench-560 sandbox (the PF-isolated bench uid of mlxfast-bench,
specified in the bench repository's own measure-job contract), and both legs
load the head out of the one pin-verified target checkpoint — the serial
denominator always runs the organizer-pinned head.
A tighter digest/exact-byte gate was considered and rejected as contradicting
that ruling; see D8 in §7 and the #20 items in §8, which record the boundary
between the fail-closed fixes (a–d) and this size-only ruling (e).

**Re-implementation:** `Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift`
in this repository. R1.1–R1.13 hold. R1.14 does not: nothing here calls the
verifier at worker spawn. Divergences D1–D4 in §7.

## 3. R2 — static review, deterministic half

Source: `.github/scripts/run-submission-static-review.sh@bfab0de:1-412`. Lines
414-698 of that file are the LLM bypass judge and are NOT ported (§9).

| # | Rule | Original |
|---|---|---|
| R2.1 | Caps: total 3,000,000 / per-file 524,288 / growth 262,144, each overridable by env, each required to be a positive integer | `bfab0de:36-38`, `bfab0de:98-109` |
| R2.2 | The growth cap exists because the total cap alone lets a small diff hide a large table | `bfab0de:348-353` |
| R2.3 | Contract must exist and be non-empty | `bfab0de:94-97` |
| R2.4 | Track id set-but-empty is fatal; an unknown track id is fatal; reviewing under another track's policy inverts every verdict | `bfab0de:40-88` |
| R2.5 | Editable path validation: non-empty, not absolute, no `\`, no leading `:` (git pathspec magic), no `/../` or `/./` component | `bfab0de:136-149` |
| R2.6 | Exempt paths are validated as paths too — they also end up in a git pathspec | `bfab0de:277-281` |
| R2.7 | In diff mode the allowlist AND the exemptions are read from the BASE commit, never from the submission work tree | `bfab0de:249-260` |
| R2.8 | `MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_BASE_SHA` set-but-empty is fatal — never degrade to whole-surface review | `bfab0de:221-227` |
| R2.9 | Base and head must resolve to commits, and the work tree must BE the review head, or the collected bytes would not match the reviewed diff | `bfab0de:235-248` |
| R2.10 | An empty allowlist is fatal, never an accidental clean pass (a jq failure inside a process substitution is invisible to `set -e`) | `bfab0de:270-275` |
| R2.11 | Exempt paths keep editable status but never enter the payload, the diff, or the growth arithmetic | `bfab0de:283-293` |
| R2.12 | A surface where every entry is exempt is fatal | `bfab0de:294-297` |
| R2.13 | Zero changed paths = clean pass, recorded as such | `bfab0de:342-346` |
| R2.14 | Growth is computed from COMMITTED blob sizes on both sides so the work tree cannot skew it | `bfab0de:354-369` |
| R2.15 | Editable files deleted vs the base are reported as the stale-clone signature and the hint is appended to any later oversize refusal | `bfab0de:319-340` |
| R2.16 | Every changed non-deleted path must be a regular file (not a symlink) in the checkout | `bfab0de:371-378` |
| R2.17 | The unified diff counts against the same total cap | `bfab0de:380-395` |
| R2.18 | Whole-surface mode (no base): every reviewed path must EXIST, and selecting zero files is fatal. Upstream selects this mode by the ABSENCE of a base sha; here it is an explicit opt-in — see D7. DIVERGED — whole-surface now also rejects a symlink or non-regular entry under a reviewed path, the check R2.16 carried only in diff mode (D8) | `bfab0de:396-412` |
| R2.19 | Every git read goes through `hardened-git.sh`, resolved next to the script (the trusted copy), never one inside the submission worktree | `bfab0de:5-14` |

`hardened-git.sh@bfab0de:1-46`: `env -i` with only `PATH` restored,
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`_SYSTEM` to `/dev/null`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`,
`HOME=/var/empty`, and `-c core.fsmonitor=false -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null -c
core.pager=cat -c protocol.ext.allow=never -c safe.directory='*'`. The threat is
a planted repo-local `.git/config` running arbitrary programs as the invoking
uid.

**Re-implementation:** `.github/scripts/submission-static-review-checks.sh` and
`.github/scripts/hardened-git.sh`. R2.1–R2.19 hold except as noted in §7 (D5,
D6).

## 4. R3 — overlay, REPLACE semantics

Retired 2026-09-09. The in-repository re-implementation
(`.github/scripts/overlay-editable-paths.sh`) had no caller on any scoring
path: Yukon's service performs the overlay of a submission archive. The rules
below describe the original for the record; R3.6 (an absent optional path keeps
the trusted copy) is the one the participant contract still states.

Source: `overlay@bfab0de:1-186` (the original).

| # | Rule | Original |
|---|---|---|
| R3.1 | `SUBMISSION_WORKTREE` required; missing worktree, missing trusted contract, or missing `jq` are all fatal | `bfab0de:5-20` |
| R3.2 | Editable path validation: non-empty, not absolute, no `\`, no `/../` or `/./` | `bfab0de:22-34` |
| R3.3 | The allowlist and the optional set come from the TRUSTED contract in the cwd, never from the submission worktree | `bfab0de:7`, `bfab0de:39`, `bfab0de:158-160`, `bfab0de:184` |
| R3.4 | REPLACE, not merge: `rm -rf` the target, then copy the submission's copy wholesale | `bfab0de:173-180` |
| R3.5 | A missing REQUIRED editable path is a loud refusal (it means a stale clone) | `bfab0de:165-166` |
| R3.6 | A missing OPTIONAL editable path is SKIPPED and the trusted copy is kept — absence means "use the organizer-pinned head", never "delete it" | `bfab0de:145-164` |
| R3.7 | Optional matching is exact string equality against `optionalEditablePaths` | `bfab0de:41-47` |
| R3.8 | Any symlink anywhere under a submitted editable path is a refusal, checked BEFORE the copy | `bfab0de:168-171` |
| R3.9 | After the copy the target tree must contain no symlink, no non-regular entry, no hardlinked file, no setuid/setgid file | `bfab0de:49-67`, `bfab0de:181` |
| R3.10 | Stale-editable-file detection is REPORT-ONLY and silently skipped without `TRUSTED_MAIN_SHA` or a resolvable merge base | `bfab0de:69-137` |

R3.6 is the rule the whole optional mechanism exists for, and the original
explains why (`bfab0de:148-160`): archives have REPLACE semantics, the head
declaration is a small opt-in file most archives will not carry, the contract
says an absent `mtp-head.manifest.json` means the organizer-pinned head, and
failing the overlay would turn the default case into a refusal. The optional set
is read from the trusted contract precisely so "a submission cannot make its own
missing source files optional."

**Re-implementation:** none. Retired; see above.

## 5. R4 — modifiable-surface gate

Retired 2026-09-09. The in-repository re-implementation
(`.github/scripts/enforce-modifiable-surface.sh`) had no caller on any scoring
path. What enforces the surface is benchd at scoring: a candidate that diverges
from its baseline outside `editablePaths` is refused. The rules below describe
the original for the record.

Source: `enforce@bfab0de:1-77` (the original).

| # | Rule | Original |
|---|---|---|
| R4.1 | `BASE_SHA` and `HEAD_SHA` required | `bfab0de:7-8` |
| R4.2 | The allowlist is read from the BASE commit so a PR cannot grant itself access | `bfab0de:2-3`, `bfab0de:34-47` |
| R4.3 | `CONTRACT_PATH` is deliberately the SAME variable the overlay and the review read, so the three gates cannot disagree about which contract binds | `bfab0de:10-16` |
| R4.4 | No fallback to `benchmark.json` on an unreadable contract — judging a submission against another track's surface would reject it naming a contract it never used | `bfab0de:38-43` |
| R4.5 | A contract with no, or an empty, `editablePaths` is fatal | `bfab0de:48-57` |
| R4.6 | A changed file matches the surface by exact equality OR by allowed-directory prefix | `bfab0de:61-76` |
| R4.7 | Every git read goes through `hardened-git.sh` from the trusted checkout | `bfab0de:18-27` |

**Re-implementation:** none. Retired; see above.

## 6. R5 — Seatbelt profile generation (KNOWN LEDGER ITEM, not resolved here)

Issue #16 lists the Seatbelt generation divergence as an already-tracked ledger
item, so this section records what the divergence IS and stops there.

Two generators produce the runtime-worker sandbox profile:

* bash — `benchmark.sh@bfab0de:1266-1307` (`write_runtime_worker_sandbox_profile`)
* Swift — `Sources/MLXFastCLI/main.swift@bfab0de:2605-2652` (`writeRuntimeWorkerSandboxProfile`)

They agree on `(allow default)`, `(deny network*)`, `(deny process-fork)`,
`(deny process-exec*)` + a literal allow for the worker binary, `(deny
file-write*)` + `/dev/null`, and the golden/private-dir read denials.

They differ in one security-relevant rule. The Swift generator emits three
`mach-lookup` denials for the mDNS resolver
(`main.swift@bfab0de:2643-2645`) with the reasoning at
`main.swift@bfab0de:2626-2635`: `(deny network*)` blocks the worker's own
sockets, but `getaddrinfo(3)` resolves via IPC to `mDNSResponder`, which
egresses from ITS uid, so a uid/socket-scoped block never sees the DNS query and
submitted code could exfiltrate over DNS. The bash generator
(`benchmark.sh@bfab0de:1287-1304`) emits no `mach-lookup` rule at all.

Consequence: any dispatch path whose profile comes from the bash generator has a
DNS-shaped exfiltration channel the Swift-generated profile closes. This
repository ships neither generator on a dispatch path today; the divergence is
recorded so whichever generator the provisioned runner adopts is the hardened
one.

## 7. Divergences in this repository's re-implementation

Each is deliberate. Each is covered by a case in
`tools/test-submission-security.sh`.

**D1 — the caps come from the manifest, not from constants.**
`benchmark.json`'s `editableSurfaceByteBudget` now carries machine-readable
`maxTotalBytes` / `maxFileBytes` / `maxGrowthBytes` alongside the existing
`exemptPathMaxBytes`. Both enforcers read them. The compiled-in constants and
the shell defaults survive only as the fallback for a contract that declares
none, and three drift tests assert they still equal the manifest. Upstream, the
numbers lived in a Swift constant (`bfab0de:18-19`) and a shell default
(`review@bfab0de:36-38`) kept in sync by a comment
(`review@bfab0de:32-35`); the manifest stated them in prose only. Issue #16
directs the manifest to be the single source.

**D2 — a present-but-malformed cap fails closed, in BOTH enforcers.** Upstream
coerced a malformed `exemptPathMaxBytes` to the default (`bfab0de:72-73`), so a
typo silently replaced the operator's intent with 2 GiB. Here the contract is
decoded with `JSONDecoder`, which refuses `true`, `"2000000"` and `3.5` for an
`Int`, and a non-positive value is rejected explicitly. Two things make the rule
hold rather than merely be stated:

* The Swift decoder is hand-written for the cap keys. The synthesized
  `decodeIfPresent` reports an explicit JSON `null` as ABSENT, which would have
  coerced `"maxTotalBytes": null` to the fallback; only a genuinely missing key
  takes the fallback now, one level up (`editableSurfaceByteBudget: null`)
  included.
* The shell enforcer type-gates on the JSON type instead of `jq -r ... // empty`.
  `// empty` read `false` and `null` as absent (silent fall to the constant) and
  `-r` stringified `"2000000"` into a value that passed the integer regex — a
  submission-supplied *string* silently widened the cap it was measured against.
  The two enforcers are now asserted to agree on `"2000000"`, `"99999999"`,
  `false`, `null`, `3.5` and `5e5` by a paired case in
  `tools/test-submission-security.sh`.

**D3 — `maxFileBytes > maxTotalBytes` is rejected.** A per-file cap that can
never bind is a configuration error that reads as a working defence. Upstream
did not check this.

**D4 — the unused `import MLXFastCore` is dropped.** Upstream imported it
without using it (`bfab0de:2`). Removing it lets the E2E suite compile the real
enforcer source directly with `swiftc` in about a second, so the suite tests the
shipped implementation instead of a copy of its rules. `swift build` compiles
the same file into the trusted-harness target unchanged.

**D5 — the static-review track default is the contract's, not `serial`.**
Upstream defaults `TRACK_ID` to `serial` when the variable is unset
(`review@bfab0de:51`). In this repository that default would review a legal
native-MTP submission under the retired serial track's total speculation ban,
where every legal submission is a critical finding. The re-implementation
defaults to the manifest's `staticReviewTrackId` and rejects any explicitly
requested track that is not the one the contract declares.

**D6 — the LLM judge half is not ported.** See §9.

**D7 — whole-surface mode is an explicit opt-in, not the fallback.** Upstream
selects the review mode by the ABSENCE of `MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_BASE_SHA`
(`review@bfab0de:221-227` makes set-but-empty fatal, but unset silently selects
whole-surface). Whole-surface mode reads the contract from the WORK TREE, which
is only safe because it is meant to run in the trusted checkout after the
overlay — a precondition the script cannot verify. As a fallback it put the
entire self-widening primitive one missing environment variable away: an
attacker checkout carrying a contract with `maxTotalBytes: 999999999` and no
base sha reviewed itself against its own caps and exited 0. Here the mode must
be named:

```text
BASE_SHA set-but-empty                    -> fatal (base computation failed)
BASE_SHA non-empty, MODE unset or "diff"  -> diff mode
BASE_SHA non-empty, MODE anything else    -> fatal (contradictory request)
BASE_SHA unset, MODE "whole-surface"      -> whole-surface mode
BASE_SHA unset, MODE anything else        -> fatal (no mode selected)
```

A caller that forgets to compute a base gets a refusal instead of the
permissive mode. Diff-mode selection is unchanged.

**A1 (addition) — the gitlink is untouchable by construction.**
`tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py` refuses any editable entry equal to, or
inside, a trusted-scope path or a gitlink. An editable entry over a gitlink
would let a submission repoint its own scorer. The original had no submodule to
protect.

The guard is CASE-FOLDED, and separately checks filesystem identity. The ranked
box is macOS and APFS is case-insensitive by default, so an entry spelled
`BENCHD` names a real path a byte comparison would pass. ASCII folding
normalises the spellings it reaches; `os.path.samefile` over every prefix of the
entry catches the ones it does not. The retired overlay and surface gate carried
the same guard; the linter is where it lives now.

**A2 (addition) — one path-validation rule, not two.** Upstream's overlay
validator (`overlay@bfab0de:22-34`) and its static-review validator
(`review@bfab0de:136-149`) implement the same concept with different rules: only
the latter rejects a leading `:`. This repository applies the stricter rule in
the static review and the linter. See Q1 below.

**D8 — the fail-closed hardening of issue #20 (a–d).** Four upstream behaviours
that read as clean passes are refusals here, each bound by a revert-proof
assertion in `tools/test-submission-security.sh` (§8 Q2/Q3/Q4/Q8 carry the
detail and the ruling): a non-regular entry — a symlink, or a FIFO/socket/device
(F1) — at or under an editable path is rejected by BOTH deterministic gates
rather than skipped, symmetrically at root and in-directory (Q2, diverges from
R1.7 and extends R2.16's diff-mode check to whole-surface R2.18); an all-absent editable surface
fails the byte budget closed rather than returning a zero-byte `.verified` (Q3,
diverges from R1.8); the exempt-cap overflow message names the aggregate, not a
single path (Q4); and the overlay fails closed on an empty or unparseable
allowlist rather than printing a successful-overlay trailer after moving nothing
(Q8). None widens the surface — every one turns a silent pass into a refusal.
The exempt-channel bound (issue #20 e) is NOT part of D8: it is a ruling item,
not a fail-closed fix. It is also moot on this track since the requant-only
ruling — nothing rides in a submission that the exempt channel could bound. A
digest gate on the STAGED head is a separate, still-open question, and it is
recorded as such in `docs/participant-contract.md` section 4.3: nothing binds
staged head bytes to the organizer's pinned digests at run time.

## 8. Ambiguities in the original that want an operator ruling

None of these block the suite; all of them shape what "parity" should mean.

**Q1 — two different definitions of a legal editable path.** `overlay@bfab0de:22-34`
omits the leading-`:` (git pathspec magic) test that `review@bfab0de:136-149`
carries. Is the laxer overlay rule intentional (the overlay never builds a
pathspec) or drift? We unified on the stricter rule.

**Q2 — the byte budget SKIPS symlinks rather than rejecting them. RULED (engine
issue #20 a): reject, in BOTH deterministic gates.** `bfab0de:37-39` justifies
skipping by saying the overlay and surface enforcement reject them separately.
That is true for a dispatch that overlays. On a path that does not — an
operator-populated checkout, a local official run — a symlink farm is uncounted
by the only gate that runs; whole-surface static review (R2.18) was blind the
same way, since `find -type f` skips a link. Both gates now fail closed on a
non-regular entry — a symlink, or (F1 gate-symmetry) a FIFO/socket/device — both
AT a root editable path and UNDER one:
`Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness/EditableSurfaceByteBudget.swift` (a divergence
from R1.7 — see D8) and `.github/scripts/submission-static-review-checks.sh`
whole-surface (the check R2.16 already carried in diff mode). The three gates
are symmetric — the budget's root branch, the budget's in-directory branch, and
the shell whole-surface gate all refuse a non-regular file at root, so none can
skip what another rejects. Bound by `budget/{editable path that IS a symlink,
symlink inside an editable path, non-regular file AT a root editable path}` and
`static-review/whole-surface {symlink inside, path that IS a symlink}` in
`tools/test-submission-security.sh`.

**Q3 — a missing editable path is treated differently by two gates on the same
surface. RULED (engine issue #20 b): the budget fails closed too.** The byte
budget skipped it (`bfab0de:115-117`) and returned `.verified` totalBytes=0
fileCount=0 when EVERY editable path was absent — absence read as a clean pass;
whole-surface static review calls it fatal (`review@bfab0de:399-402`). The two
now agree: the budget refuses a surface that walked to zero files, mirroring the
shell gate's `file_count == 0` guard. Bound by `budget/every editable path
absent fails closed`.

**Q4 — the exempt cap is an aggregate charged with a per-path message. RULED
(engine issue #20 c): name the aggregate.** `exemptBytes` accumulates across ALL
exempt paths (`bfab0de:100`) but the refusal named only the path being walked
when the cap tripped (`bfab0de:104-106`) — exact with today's single exempt
path, misattributing with two. The message now names the aggregate and the
number of exempt paths, not a single path. Bound by `budget/exempt aggregate
overflow names the aggregate, not one path`.

**Q5 — the growth cap has no launch-time counterpart.** `MAX_GROWTH_BYTES`
exists only in the static review, because the launch has no base commit. A
dispatch path that skips review therefore has no growth bound, only the total
and per-file caps — which is exactly the gap R2.2 says the growth cap exists to
close. Accepted risk, or does the launch path need a recorded base?

**Q6 — the setuid check runs on the copy, after the copy stripped it.**
`validate_overlay_tree` (`bfab0de:63-66`) inspects the TARGET, but the
unprivileged `tar`/`cp` at `bfab0de:173-180` already drops setuid/setgid on
extraction. The check can only fire under root, or a `tar` invoked with `-p`.
The SOURCE tree is never checked for setuid. The guarantee that actually holds
is "the bit never lands", and the suite asserts that rather than the refusal.

**Q7 — the byte caps' authority.** Upstream stated 3 MB / 512 KiB in prose in
the manifest, as a Swift constant, and as a shell default. If they ever
disagreed, nothing said which won. D1 makes the manifest win here; that wants
ratifying before it is treated as the contract.

**Q8 — the overlay reports success after overlaying NOTHING. RULED (engine issue
#20 d): fail closed on an empty or unparseable allowlist.** `overlay@bfab0de`
read `.editablePaths[]` in the loop header, so a trusted contract with
`editablePaths` empty, absent, or unparseable produced zero iterations and the
`trusted harness retained; ... overlaid` trailer still printed at exit 0. The
direction is SAFE (the trusted tree is kept, nothing hostile lands) but the
false success lets a pipeline measure the trusted tree and attribute the score
to a submission that overlaid nothing. The allowlist is now read up front and an
empty or unparseable contract fails closed before the trailer. Bound by
`overlay/{empty editablePaths, missing editablePaths key, unparseable contract}
fails closed, not a no-op success`.

**Q9 — may an environment variable re-state a run's caps at all? RULED (David
2026-08-20), engine issue #20, review finding B6 / R1.15: align shell to Swift,
`manifest > constant`.** The shell enforcer used to resolve each cap as
`environment > manifest > constant`
(`.github/scripts/submission-static-review-checks.sh`, `resolve_cap`) while the
Swift enforcer had no environment path at all, so D1's "the manifest is the
single source" held for one enforcer and not the other.

`MLXFAST_SUBMISSION_STATIC_REVIEW_MAX_BYTES`, `_MAX_FILE_BYTES` and
`_MAX_GROWTH_BYTES` are now **removed** from the shell gate — not deprecated,
not outranked. Both enforcers resolve `manifest > constant` and D1 holds
everywhere. The lever the overrides gave a trusted operator (re-state one run's
caps without editing the contract) is deliberately given up: a cap that can be
re-stated out of band is not a single source, and the reviewed run could differ
from the contract with nothing in the record saying so. Neither direction was
ever a submission-reachable bypass — the variables were trusted-operator inputs
and a submission has no way to set them — so this closed a doctrine divergence,
not a hole.

`tools/test-submission-security.sh` binds both halves: it runs the gate with all
three variables set to legal out-of-contract values and asserts the manifest
values still come back, and it asserts the script's code reads none of them.
Reintroducing an environment path here means reopening #20.

## 9. Not ported

* **The LLM bypass judge** — `review@bfab0de:414-698`: the track-selected
  controlling decode rules, the system prompt, the Anthropic call, retry
  handling, and the verdict/severity reconciliation at `bfab0de:678-698`. It is
  policy, it needs a credential and a network, and it cannot run pre-dispatch on
  an offline box. The deterministic half is what can be a test and it fails
  closed on its own. When the judge is added, `bfab0de:684-694` is the rule that
  matters most: a schema-valid but self-contradictory verdict —
  `passed=true` with `severity` `high` or `critical`, the shape a partially
  successful prompt injection in the reviewed code produces — is forced to
  FAILED regardless of the reported `passed` value.
* **The Seatbelt generators** — §6, a known ledger item.
* **`verify-trusted-source-scope.sh`** — the fifth load-bearing gate named in
  §0. Two halves: a byte-identity re-verification of every trusted-harness
  source input against the trusted git content immediately before the trusted
  build, and `verify_contract_does_not_expose_trusted_scope@bfab0de:117-139`,
  a standing tripwire that refuses any `editablePaths` entry overlapping the
  trusted scope — read from the TRUSTED ref so an overlaid contract cannot
  steer it. Addition A1 here is the same idea narrowed to `benchd` and
  `.gitmodules`.

  The general form is now **split**, not wholly absent. Its REST-STATE half
  exists: `tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py` check 3c refuses any
  `editablePaths` / `optionalEditablePaths` /
  `editableSurfaceByteBudget.exemptPaths` entry overlapping
  `Sources/MLXFastTrustedHarness`, `Sources/MLXFastCLI`, `Sources/MLXFastCore`,
  `Package.swift` or `Package.resolved`, by the same overlap relation upstream
  uses (`paths_overlap@bfab0de:117-121`), and it runs in CI on every push and
  pull request. So the gap this paragraph used to describe — that nothing here
  covered the trusted source trees or the frozen manifests — is closed for the
  contract **at rest**.

  What stays deferred is the RUN-TIME half, and it is the larger one: reading
  the contract from the TRUSTED ref rather than from the tree (so an overlaid
  `benchmark.json` cannot steer the check), and byte-identity re-verification of
  every trusted-harness source input immediately before the trusted build. Both
  need a bench workspace and a trusted-ref pair, which arrive with runner
  provisioning (#36), so they are deferred rather than declined. Until they
  land, check 3c is a rest-state tripwire over the contract this repository
  ships — it cannot see a submission that edits trusted sources without
  declaring them, which is exactly what the run-time half is for.
* **`pin-trusted-harness.sh`** — content pins over the built trusted CLI and
  the participant worker, captured on either side of the participant build so
  build-time code execution cannot alter the trusted binary between build and
  pin. Needs built artifacts; runner provisioning.
* **`deny-private-artifacts.sh`** — refuses artifact and cache uploads that
  could leak hidden prompts, golden tokens, model shards, symlinks, or
  unexpectedly large files. Needs an artifact channel; runner provisioning.
* **The workflow that sequences these gates** — runner provisioning, #36
  cross-repo.
* **The launch-time CALL SITE** — `main.swift@bfab0de:2286`. The enforcer class
  is restored and tested; wiring it into the worker-spawn preflight lands with
  runner provisioning, behind the hard gate below.

## 10. The hard gate

`tools/test-submission-security.sh` must be green before any real submission is
dispatched, to dev-Yukon or anywhere else. It needs no weights, no GPU, no
network and no box:

```bash
tools/test-submission-security.sh
```

It builds the real byte-budget enforcer with `swiftc`, synthesizes hostile
archives (oversize file, oversize total, lookup-table smuggle by count and by
growth, symlink, absolute-symlink, path escape, gitlink and `.gitmodules`
replacement, non-editable-path write, `optionalEditablePaths` abuse via a
submission-supplied contract, hardlink, setuid, self-widened contract), asserts
each dies at the right layer with the right diagnostic, and finishes by checking
the real tree against its own manifest and the manifest against both enforcers'
fallbacks.

### It runs automatically, and it gates nothing automatically

The `swift` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the suite on every pull
request and every push to `main`, and re-checks its non-vacuity floor against
the printed trailer from outside the suite file. **That CI is advisory, by
ruling** (David 2026-08-20 — the two-session red-team is the de facto merge
gate). It is not a mechanical interlock, and the distinction matters here more
than usual because §9 above is what would supply one:

- **no status check is required**: branch protection is unavailable on this
  repository's plan (the API answers 403), so no required-status-check rule
  exists for this job or any other;
- there is no `CODEOWNERS`, so no review is mechanically required either;
- the ranked workflow is the fail-closed stub described in §9 and never invokes
  the suite;
- a **ranked** `workflow_dispatch` does not consult `ci.yml` (that file has a
  `workflow_dispatch` trigger of its own, for re-running CI by hand; it is not
  the ranked dispatch).

Until the dispatch path in §9 exists, the sentence at the top of this section is
a rule people follow, enforced by reading the run and by the red-team passes —
not by the runner refusing one. `docs/ci-coverage.md` states the same thing from
the CI side.
