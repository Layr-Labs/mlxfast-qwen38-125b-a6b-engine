// REQUANT-ONLY (David ruling, 2026-08-26): `pinned` is the ONLY source this
// track accepts. The two speculative heads are the organizer's own weights. A
// participant may declare a re-quantization of them and may not substitute
// weights of their own.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE USED TO SAY, AND WHY IT FLIPPED. Under DECIDE-2 Q-B a
// bring-your-own head was gated by SIZE ONLY: `in_branch` and `remote` were
// accepted flows, a digestless head was fine, and the byte cap was the whole
// gate. Every one of those accept-cases is now a REFUSAL case, because the
// mechanism they exercised is retired. The tests are flipped rather than
// deleted: an accept-case turned refusal-case is the assertion that goes red if
// someone restores the source, where a deleted test is just silence.
//
// TWO LAYERS, ONE RULING. `benchmark.json` drops `mtp-head/` and `dflash-head/`
// from `editablePaths`, so head weights cannot RIDE IN a submission; this parser
// refuses the declarations that would ask the runner to GO AND GET some. Neither
// half is sufficient alone, so both land together.
//
// FIX-BAR / mutation to kill: restoring `case .remote` or `case .inBranch` to a
// non-throwing branch in `Gemma4MTPHeadDeclaration.parse` must turn
// `inBranchSourceIsRefused` and `remoteSourceIsRefused` RED.
