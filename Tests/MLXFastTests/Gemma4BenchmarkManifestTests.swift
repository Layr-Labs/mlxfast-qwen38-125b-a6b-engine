// Structural checks on the Yukon track manifest (benchmark.json) for track
// qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1. This is NOT a re-implementation of Yukon's zod
// schema (src/benchmark/manifest.ts, RawBenchmarkConfigSchema /
// parseRepositoryBenchmarkManifest) -- that schema was validated directly by
// running `bun run` against the real yukon checkout
// ($HOME/projects/layr-labs/.worktrees/yukon-gemma-onboarding),
// importing parseRepositoryBenchmarkManifest and feeding it this file's own
// benchmark.json at authoring time, which returned PARSE OK with
// schemaVersion 1 and the expected editablePathsCount. That is a one-time,
// external verification method (recorded here so it can be re-run, not
// because this suite re-implements it) and is out of this repository's swift
// test loop because it needs the yukon checkout and its own bun/npm
// dependency tree, neither of which this repository depends on or vendors.
//
// What THIS suite pins, so a manifest edit cannot silently drift from the
// tree it describes or from tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py's own rules
// without a swift test failure calling it out:
//   - benchmark.json parses as JSON and required top-level keys are present
//     with the right JSON type (a lightweight mirror of the zod schema's
//     shape requirements, not a full re-implementation).
//   - every editablePaths / optionalEditablePaths entry exists in this repo's
//     tree (repo-root relative, same as the Yukon importer resolves them).
//   - optionalEditablePaths is a subset of editablePaths.
//   - no two editablePaths entries are duplicates or nest inside each other.
//   - scorePath is not inside any editablePaths entry.
//   - runner.workflow names a real file under .github/workflows/.
//   - contractPath exists, parses as JSON, and its track_id equals trackId.
//   - editableSurfaceByteBudget's four numeric caps equal the compiled-in
//     EditableSurfaceByteBudget defaults (manifest/enforcer drift guard,
//     mirroring tools/lint-benchmark-manifest.py check 3b).
//
// Scope note: no MLX device work, no weights, no GPU, no network, and the pinned
// benchd is NOT required to be resolved (benchd-bin/ need not exist) -- every
// assertion below is static content / filesystem existence, exactly like
// HarnessHashRootSetTests's own scope note.
